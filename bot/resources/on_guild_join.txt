The infamous **{bot.user.name}** has graced your ~~lowly~~ server!

My current prefix is **{bot.default_prefix}**...obviously

**__Setup__**
- Set channel tags to allow commands to be used
    - e.g **{bot.default_prefix}config channel game** which whitelists that channel to use all the games

- __Auto Battles Online Server__
    - Set a member role by doing **{bot.default_prefix}config role member <role>**
    - Register a channel as an ABO channel by doing **{bot.default_prefix}config channel abo**
